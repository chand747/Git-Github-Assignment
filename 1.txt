Explain what version control is and its importance in software development?
Solution:-
- Version control, also known as source control.
- It is a tool that allows developers to track and manage changes to files over time.
- It allows developers to see who made what changes and when, and to revert to previous versions of the code if needed.
- It's important in software development because it helps developers collaborate and ensures that different versions of a document are easy to identify:

Here are some of its importance in software development -
i) Collaboration:
It makes it easy for multiple developers to work on the same project at the same time. 
Developers can create their own branches of the code to work on new features or fix bugs, and then merge 
their changes back into the main codebase once they are complete.

ii) History:
 It keeps a complete history of all changes to the code. This makes it easy to track down the source of 
a bug or to revert to a previous version of the code if necessary.

iii) Backup: 
 It serves as a backup for the code. If a developer accidentally deletes a file or makes a mistake, 
they can easily restore the file or revert to a previous version of the code.

iv) Auditing: 
 It can be used to audit changes to the code. This can be helpful for tracking down security 
vulnerabilities or for complying with regulations.

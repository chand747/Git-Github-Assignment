Explain the Git Workflow, including the staging area, working directory, and repository?
Solution:-
- The Git workflow is a set of steps and stages that developers follow to manage and track changes 
effectively using Git, a popular version control system. It involves three main components: 
the working directory, the staging area (also known as the index), and the repository.

i) Working directory:
The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.

ii) Staging area:
The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. Its technical name in Git parlance is the “index”, but the phrase “staging area” works just as well.

iii) The Repository:
The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.
